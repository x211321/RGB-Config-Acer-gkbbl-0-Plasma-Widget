 # Installation
> âš  Make sure you have the **acer-gkbbl-0** RGB device available before you proceed with the installation of this application, otherwise it will have no effect. Visit JafarAkhondali's [project page](https://github.com/JafarAkhondali/acer-predator-turbo-and-rgb-keyboard-linux-module) for more information on the required kernel module.

## Manual install (GUI)
I have not yet uploaded the widget to the KDE store, I plan on doing so once the widget has been tested for a while.

To manually install the widget download the **.plasmoid** file from the [releases page](https://github.com/x211321/RGB-Config-Acer-gkbbl-0-Plasma-Widget/releases) and open it through the KDE widget manager. 

### **Open the KDE widget manager**

### **Select "Install Widget From Local File"**

### **Navigate to the previously downloaded .plasmoid file and double click the file name**

### **The widget should now display in your system tray**

From here out you can either use the widget via the system tray or use the KDE widget manager to place the widget on your desktop, taskbar or wherever you like.

You can disable the widget via the KDE system tray configuration if you don't want it in your system tray.


## Manual install (Command line)
Use the following command to install the widget via command line
```
plasmapkg2 -i RGB-Config-Acer-<VERSION>.plasmoid
```

## Manual update
KDE Plasma can be somewhat finicky when it comes to manually updating plasma widgets, at least in my experience. 

I usually update the widget via the command line and afterwards restart the plasma shell. This way I don't have to deal with the process in the widget manager.

```
plasmapkg2 -u RGB-Config-Acer-<VERSION>.plasmoid
nohup plasmashell --replace &
```

# Configuration
As usual right clicking the widget brings up an option to open the widget configuration. Thus far three options are available.

![Config general](./screenshots/config_general.png)

## Show header
Display a label at the top of the widget displaying the widget name.

## Apply last settings on startup
Automatically apply the last used RGB settings when the widget is started. This way the RGB settings are automatically restored when you log into KDE Plasma.

## Tray icon color
I've not yet figured out how to integrate the icon color with the active color theme. For now this option allows you to adjust the icon color manually.

## Manual install (GUI)
I have not yet uploaded the widget to the KDE store, I plan on doing so once the widget has been tested for a while.

To manually install the widget download the **.plasmoid** file from the [releases page](https://github.com/x211321/RGB-Config-Acer-gkbbl-0-Plasma-Widget/releases) and open it through the KDE widget manager. 

### **Open the KDE widget manager**

### **Select "Install Widget From Local File"**

### **Navigate to the previously downloaded .plasmoid file and double click the file name**

![Install select plasmoid file](./screenshots/install_select_plasmoid_file.png)


### **The widget should now display in your system tray**

From here out you can either use the widget via the system tray or use the KDE widget manager to place the widget on your desktop, taskbar or wherever you like.

You can disable the widget via the KDE system tray configuration if you don't want it in your system tray.


## Manual install (Command line)
Use the following command to install the widget via command line
```
plasmapkg2 -u RGB-Config-Acer-<VERSION>.plasmoid
```
